# 🌍 BetterFriend Translations

Help make BetterFriend accessible to everyone by contributing translations! 💜

## 🧩 How It Works

1. Fork this repository

2. Create a new branch for your language or changes

3. Add your translation file:

   - Use en.js as a template
   - Rename it using the 2-letter ISO language code:
     - en.js (English)
     - pt.js (Portuguese)
     - es.js (Spanish)
     - etc.

4. Translate all values while keeping the keys unchanged

5. Run validator.js to ensure everything is correct

6. Open a Pull Request (PR)

7. Wait for review and approval 🚀

## ⚠️ Important Guidelines

- Do not change the keys, only translate the values

- Keep translations clear and natural, not literal when it sounds wrong

- Make sure your file passes validator.js before submitting

- One language per PR (keeps reviews simple)
